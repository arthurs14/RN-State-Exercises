# Demoing State and Layouts

Just a simple bare to the bones application focusing on the types of state that
can be used in React Native along with understanding how to layout elements in
the view.

## Installation

Since it is only to demo and understand the concepts, an android/ iOS simulator
can be used. Install whole directory, then type 'npm i', then run command
'npm run android' or 'npm run ios'.
